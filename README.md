# AutonoMind

This project contains a FastAPI backend and a Next.js frontend.

## Starting the backend

Make sure you launch the FastAPI application from `app/main.py` so that all routers are loaded:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
The server exposes a `/ping` endpoint for simple health checks.

## Frontend configuration

The frontend discovers the backend URL at runtime. `entrypoint.sh` writes
`webapp/public/env.js` containing `window.RUNTIME_FASTAPI_URL` which points to
the FastAPI proxy. During development, Next.js proxies `/api/*` to your local
backend, while in production the app fetches this runtime variable.

If `RUNPOD_POD_ID` is present the entrypoint derives the URL as
`https://$RUNPOD_POD_ID-8000.proxy.runpod.net` and exports
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_URL` for serverâ€‘side rendering. No build-time argument is
required.

Example Fly deployment:

**Do not append `:3000` to the public URL.** The Fly proxy maps incoming
traffic on ports 80 and 443 to the container's internal port 3000, so your
frontend is available directly at `https://your-app.fly.dev`.

```bash
fly deploy -e NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_URL=https://your-app.fly.dev
```

When `RUNPOD_URL` is configured on the backend, heavy tasks like audio
transcription and image OCR will be delegated to that remote pod.

To confirm the frontend picked up the correct backend URL, hit `/api/debug-env`
after deployment. It should return the value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_URL`.

The container exposes `/ping` on port 8000 which can be used for health checks
before starting the frontend

```

A sample `.env` file is provided at `webapp/.env.example`.

## Using the API manually

Remember that text, voice and image inputs share the `/input` prefix:

- `POST /input/text`
- `POST /input/voice`
- `POST /input/image`

`/input/text` and `/input/search` run a regular web search for the given query.
`/input/voice` returns the transcribed text of the uploaded audio file.
Use `/chat` to question any PDFs or images you've uploaded previously.

Upload PDFs or images for retrieval using `POST /upload` and send chat messages via `POST /chat`.
If the request omits a `session_id`, the server now generates a new one automatically and
returns it in the response. Keep this id and include it in later requests so your uploaded
files can be queried. Each session id remains valid for roughly an hour.

Images uploaded for CLIP similarity search are stored under the `/images`
path exposed by the API. Results returned by `/search/image-similarity` use
these URLs so they can be viewed directly in the browser.
When you POST an image to `/chat`, the server now tries an image similarity
lookup first and only falls back to OCR-based search when no strong match is
found.
